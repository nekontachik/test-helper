# UI Migration Plan: Chakra UI to Shadcn UI

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Installed Tailwind CSS and configured it
2. ✅ Installed Shadcn UI and its dependencies
3. ✅ Updated the existing ClientOnly component to handle hydration issues
4. ✅ Created a custom hook for media queries (useMediaQuery)
5. ✅ Created the Atomic Design folder structure
6. ✅ Migrated the StatCard component to Shadcn UI
7. ✅ Created a new SignInForm component using Shadcn UI
8. ✅ Set up Storybook for component development
9. ✅ Created stories for the StatCard and SignInForm components
10. ✅ Fixed duplicate components (ClientOnly)
11. ✅ Updated the dashboard page to use the new StatCard component

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Replace the existing SignInForm component with the new one
2. [ ] Migrate other form components to use Shadcn UI
3. [ ] Create more atomic components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
4. [ ] Update the layout components to use Tailwind CSS
5. [ ] Create a theme provider for consistent styling
6. [ ] Implement dark mode support
7. [ ] Fix Storybook configuration to work with Tailwind CSS
8. [ ] Create documentation for the component library

## Migration Strategy

1. **Component by Component**: Migrate one component at a time, starting with the most frequently used ones.
2. **Page by Page**: After migrating the core components, update each page to use the new components.
3. **Use ClientOnly**: Wrap components with hydration issues in the ClientOnly component.
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test each migrated component to ensure it works correctly.
5. **Document Everything**: Create documentation for each component in Storybook.

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Better Developer Experience**: Shadcn UI provides a more consistent and maintainable component library.
2. **Improved Performance**: Tailwind CSS is more performant than Chakra UI's CSS-in-JS approach.
3. **Solved Hydration Issues**: The ClientOnly component prevents hydration mismatches.
4. **Better Organization**: The Atomic Design methodology provides a clear structure for components.
5. **Easier Customization**: Shadcn UI components are copied into your project, making them easier to customize.
6. **Better Accessibility**: Shadcn UI is built on Radix UI primitives, which have excellent accessibility features.
7. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI result in smaller bundle sizes compared to Chakra UI.

## Potential Issues and Solutions

1. **Duplicate Components**: We found duplicate components (ClientOnly, StatCard) that needed to be resolved.
   - Solution: Keep one version and update imports to use it.

2. **Existing Shadcn UI Components**: Some Shadcn UI components were already in use.
   - Solution: Leverage existing components and ensure consistency.

3. **Hydration Issues**: Hydration mismatches between server and client rendering.
   - Solution: Use the ClientOnly component to render components only on the client side.
