## Test Case Versioning

The application now supports test case versioning. Each time a test case is updated, a new version is created. Users can view the version history and restore previous versions if needed.

### Viewing Version History

To view the version history of a test case:

1. Navigate to the test case details page
2. Scroll down to the "Version History" section
3. Click on a version to view its details

### Restoring a Previous Version

To restore a previous version of a test case:

1. Navigate to the test case details page
2. Scroll down to the "Version History" section
3. Click on the version you want to restore
4. In the version details modal, click "Restore This Version"

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/test-cases/{testCaseId}/versions`: Get all versions of a test case
- `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/test-cases/{testCaseId}/restore`: Restore a specific version of a test case

## Development

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To start the development server:

- Core Chakra UI package (@chakra-ui/react)
- Theme customization
- Provider configuration

## Component Usage

### Basic Components

## Directory Structure

All source code should be placed in the `/src` directory:
- App code goes in `/src/app`
- Components go in `/src/components`
- Library code goes in `/src/lib`

‚ùå Do not create files in the root `/app` directory - use `/src/app` instead.
