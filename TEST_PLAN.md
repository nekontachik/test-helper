# Test Plan for Test Helper Project

## 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the strategy for improving test coverage and ensuring the quality of the Test Helper application. Our goal is to systematically increase test coverage, focusing on critical components and functionality first.

## 2. Test Objectives

- Increase overall test coverage to at least 80%
- Ensure all critical paths and components are thoroughly tested
- Validate that all features work as expected
- Identify and fix any bugs or issues
- Improve the reliability and maintainability of the codebase

## 3. Test Strategy

We will follow a bottom-up testing approach, starting with unit tests and moving up to integration and end-to-end tests. We will prioritize testing based on the criticality of components and their impact on the overall application.

### 3.1 Types of Testing

1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. Component Testing
4. API Testing
5. End-to-End Testing (to be implemented in a later phase)

### 3.2 Tools

- Jest: For unit and integration testing
- React Testing Library: For component testing
- Supertest: For API testing
- Cypress: For end-to-end testing (future implementation)

## 4. Test Plan Execution

### Phase 1: Unit and Integration Testing

1. Set up test environment and configure Jest
2. Write tests for utility functions and helpers
3. Test API client functions
4. Test custom hooks

### Phase 2: Component Testing

1. Test reusable UI components
2. Test form components
3. Test page components

### Phase 3: API Testing

1. Test API routes
2. Test error handling and edge cases

### Phase 4: Integration Testing

1. Test interactions between components
2. Test data flow through the application

## 5. Test Prioritization

1. Critical components and functionality:

   - Project creation and management
   - Test case creation and management
   - Test run execution
   - Report generation

2. Error handling and edge cases

3. UI components and user interactions

4. Performance and optimization features

## 6. Reporting and Metrics

- Use Jest's built-in coverage reporting
- Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests and generate coverage reports automatically
- Track progress using the following metrics:
  - Overall code coverage percentage
  - Number of passing/failing tests
  - Time taken for test execution

## 7. Timeline and Milestones

- Week 1: Set up testing environment and start unit testing
- Week 2: Complete unit testing and begin component testing
- Week 3: Complete component testing and start API testing
- Week 4: Complete API testing and begin integration testing
- Week 5: Finish integration testing and address any remaining gaps in coverage

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

- Developers: Write and maintain tests, fix issues uncovered by tests
- QA Team: Review test plans, assist in writing complex test scenarios
- Project Manager: Track progress, ensure testing milestones are met

## 9. Risks and Mitigation

- Risk: Time constraints may limit thorough testing
  Mitigation: Prioritize critical components and gradually increase coverage

- Risk: Complex components may be difficult to test
  Mitigation: Break down complex components, use mocking and stubbing techniques

- Risk: Changing requirements may invalidate existing tests
  Mitigation: Maintain clear communication with the product team, update tests alongside feature changes

## 10. Approval and Sign-off

This test plan is subject to approval by the project manager and lead developer. Updates to the plan will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
