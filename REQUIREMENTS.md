## Glossary of Terms

- Project: The main organizational unit in the system that groups related test cases and test runs.
- Test Case: A set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether an application or system is working correctly.
- Test Steps: A sequence of actions to be performed to conduct a test.
- Expected Result: The outcome that should be obtained after executing a test case if the system is working correctly.
- Test Run: An execution of a set of test cases.
- Soft Delete: A method of marking a record as deleted in the database without physically removing it.

## Priority 1: Project Management

### Backend:

1. Data Model:

   - Create Project model with fields: id, name, description, created_at, updated_at, status
   - Implement relationship between Project and User (project creator)

2. API Endpoints:

   - POST /api/projects - create a new project
   - GET /api/projects - retrieve list of projects
   - GET /api/projects/{id} - retrieve details of a specific project
   - PUT /api/projects/{id} - update project information
   - DELETE /api/projects/{id} - delete project (soft delete)

3. Business Logic:

   - Validate input data for project creation and update
   - Implement pagination for project list
   - Implement project filtering by status

4. Authorization:

   - Check user access rights for each project operation

5. Error Handling:

   - Implement handling of common errors (e.g., project not found, access denied)

6. Logging:

   - Set up logging for important events (project creation, deletion)

7. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Configure logging for all CRUD operations with projects
   - Implement performance monitoring for API endpoints (response time, request count)
   - Set up alerts for critical errors

### Frontend:

1. Components:

   - ProjectList - for displaying the list of projects
   - ProjectCard - for displaying brief project information in the list
   - ProjectDetails - for showing full project information
   - CreateProjectModal - modal window for creating a new project
   - EditProjectForm - form for editing project information

2. Pages:

   - Project list (/projects)
   - Project details (/projects/{id})

3. State Management:

   - Create a store for project data
   - Implement actions for CRUD operations with projects

4. UI/UX:

   - Implement pagination for the project list
   - Add ability to sort projects by various parameters
   - Implement project filtering by status
   - Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations

5. Forms:

   - Implement validation for project creation and editing forms
   - Add error handling for form submissions

6. API Integration:

   - Implement a service for interacting with the backend API
   - Handle API responses and errors

7. Responsive Design:

   - Ensure correct display on various devices

8. Accessibility:

   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Add ARIA attributes to improve accessibility

9. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Implement logging of user actions (project creation, editing)
   - Configure sending error information to the server
   - Implement collection of performance metrics (component load time)

### Constraints:

1. Technical Constraints:

   - Maximum number of projects per user: 50
   - Maximum project name length: 100 characters
   - Maximum project description length: 1000 characters
   - Supported browsers: latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

2. Business Constraints:
   - A project can only be deleted by a user with the "Administrator" role
   - Changing the project status to "Completed" must be confirmed with an additional prompt

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. User can create a new project by filling out a form with fields: name (required) and description.
2. The main page displays a list of projects with basic information (name, status, creation date).
3. Clicking on a project opens a page with detailed information.
4. User can edit project information.
5. Project list pagination is implemented (20 projects per page).
6. User can filter projects by status.
7. All CRUD operations work without errors and update data in real-time.
8. The interface is responsive and displays correctly on mobile devices.
9. All actions with projects are properly logged and available for audit.
10. The system correctly handles cases of reaching limits (e.g., maximum number of projects).

## Priority 1: Test Case Management

### Backend:

1. Data Model:

   - Create TestCase model with fields: id, project_id, title, description, steps, expected_result, priority, status, created_at, updated_at

   - PUT /api/projects/{projectId}/test-cases/{id} - update test case information
   - DELETE /api/projects/{projectId}/test-cases/{id} - delete test case (soft delete)

3. Business Logic:

   - Validate input data for test case creation and update
   - Implement pagination for test case list
